    "### CCRB Complaints Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCRB (Civilian Complaint Review Board) dataset contains records of civilian complaints filed against NYPD officers. Each row represents one closed complaint case and includes information about the officer involved, the type of allegation, the date of the incident, and the final disposition of the investigation. The dataset contains 33,358 complaint cases and 27 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key variables for this project are officer race, allegation type, disposition and incident date. Officer race is a categorical variable identifying the race of the officer involved in the complaint (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American). Allegation type describes the nature of the complaint, such as abuse of authority, use of force, or offensive language. Incident date is recorded as a calendar date and indicates when the complaint occurred. Disposition describes the outcome of the CCRB investigation and typically falls into categories such as substantiated, unsubstantiated, or exonerated. These metrics allow us to quantify complaint patterns across officer racial groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several important limitations to this dataset. Complaint data reflects reported incidents, not confirmed misconduct. Some misconduct may go unreported due to many reasons, some of which include lack of trust in reporting systems, or lack of awareness of the complaint process. Reporting rates may also vary across neighborhoods and communities, which introduces potential reporting bias. Additionally, some fields contain missing values, particularly in demographic related columns. Because of these concerns, complaint counts should not be interpreted as direct measures of officer behavior but rather as reported interactions that triggered formal complaints."

    "### NYPD Personnel Demographics \n",
    "\n",
    "The NYPD Personnel Demographics dataset holds the demographic breakdown for active NYPD personnel. Each row lists an officer with a given race, rank (officer, lieutenant, etc), gender and the number of years on the job. This dataset has 50,104 observations with 8 variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The important variables we care about are Race, Rank, and YearsOnJob which all describe an officer's identity. Rank is a categorical variable which lists them as a Police Officer, Sergeant, etc as a hierarchy. YearsOnJob is a quantitative variable which lists the number of years they have been apart of the NYPD. These 2 variables are important because they represent an officer's experience which will influence assignments and complaint rates. This is because higher ranked officers are less likely to interact as much with civilians. The final key variable will be Race (Asian, Black, White, Hispanic, Native American, and White) will serve as a sort of baseline to compare racism with.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this dataset is to establish expected proportions for officer complaint analysis. This will look to find if there is disproportionate representative of complaints in regards to NYPD proportions. The problems with this dataset is some appdate is hidden visually but this can be solved using pandas. The dataset also holds to NYPD classification of race groups making them rigid and won't represent an officer's identity with 100% accuracy. This dataset only includes active officers which doesn't line up with some of our other datasets.  "

    "### NYPD Arrests Data (Historic) \n",
    "\n",
    "This NYPD Arrests Dataset contains information for every arrest that has occured in 2006, aswell as 19 variables on each arrest. The variables of note to this project are \"ARREST_DATE\", \"OFNS_DESC\", \"LAW_CAT_CD\", \"ARREST_PRECINCT\", \"AGE_GROUP\" and \"PERP_RACE\". Arrest date is the date in which the arrest occured, OFNS_DESC is a written description of the offense commited by the perpetrator, LAW_CAT_CD is the level of the offense(ex: felony, misdemeanor, etc.), ARREST_PRECINCT is the precient in which the offense occured, AGE_GROUP is the age grouping in which the perpetrator was(standardized to 5 categories ['25-44', '18-24', '45-64', '<18', '65+'] and PERP_RACE which is the race of perpetrator standardized to White, Black, Asian, Native American, and Unknown. While all these varibles that we narrowed the dataset down to are important, a very key variable will be ARREST_PRECINCT, as since our hypothesis is on complaints filed towards officers, using the precinct number it allows us to trace this information down towards the precincts that the officers work in, thus making this data more useful in answering our question.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important distinction in this dataset is that while it is arrest data, it more importantly represents the enforcement activity, not just the crime in itself, and areas where more arrests occur, may reflect the police presence and patterns of policing more than the actual crime in the area."

This dataset contains approximately 8.5 million residents with demographic estimates across 6 regions and approximately 90 categories for each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important variables are the race proportions: White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, American Indian, and Pacific Islander. These are provided as both counts and percentages for each borough and for NYC as a whole. The race categories are categorical variables that represent the racial composition of NYC's population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this dataset is to establish expected proportions for arrest analysis.The problems with this dataset include that all proportions and estimates are not exact and are given with margins of error, as they come from survey estimates rather than exact counts. Additionally, the dataset represents a snapshot from the 2012-2016 ACS 5-year estimates, which may not reflect current population demographics if used for more recent analyses."

    "### A. Data Collection \n",
    "- [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project uses publicly available government and research datasets from sources such as NYC Open Data rather than collecting data directly from individuals. Because we are not interacting with individuals or collecting personal responses, traditional informed consent does not apply. However, we will still use the data responsibly and follow any data use guidelines provided by the original data sources. We will also be careful to present results in ways that do not harm individuals or communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be bias in civilian complaint data because not all misconduct gets reported. For example some people may not file complaints if they don't trust the police, don't know how to report, or think it won't make a difference. These are just some of the many reasons. Reporting may also vary between different communities. Because of this, complaint numbers don't perfectly show officer behavior. In our project, we will keep this limitation in mind and avoid treating complaint counts as direct proot of misconduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only use data that does not include personal identifying information or is grouped together so individual officers cannot be identified. For example we will not use officer names, badge numbers, or other identifying details. All results will be reported in group or summary form instead of focusing on individuals. This will help protect privacy and reduces the risk of someone being singled out or misidentified. We want to make sure our analysis focuses on overall trends rather than specific people.\n",
    "       \n",
    "- [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this project studies racial differences, it is important to carefully interpret results and avoid reinforcing stereotypes. We will be sure to frame findings as structural or systemic patterns rather than individual blame. We will also emphasize limitations of the data when presenting results. We will also be careful with how we explain our findings so they are not taken out of context. Our goal is to help people understand patterns in the data, not make assumptions about individuals or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    "- [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "All the datasets we used are publicly available and will be stored securely in password protected university environments such as  \n",
    "Datahub. Access will be limited among our project group only. Even though the data is public, we will still handle it responsibly and avoid storing unnecessary copies. Project files will only be shared within our group.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "- [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will only be stored for the duration of the course project. After the project is completed, local copies will be deleted and only final analysis outputs will remain in the project repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    "- [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis focuses on complaint data and officer demographics, which does not capture the full social and historical context of policing. We will be sure to acknowledge that complaint data does not fully represent all community experiences and will avoid making broad claims about behavior or intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Complaint data may reflect reporting bias, systemic bias, and uneven enforcement patterns. Not all misconduct is reported, and reporting rates may vary across different communities or neighborhoods. Because of this, complaint numbers may not fully represent actual behavior or incidents. We will test distributions carefully and clearly separate correlation from causation when interpreting results. We will also acknowledge these limitations when presenting our findings.\n",
    "       \n",
    "- [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "All visualizations and statistics will be presented clearly and without exaggeration. We will avoid making graphs that could be misleading or confusing to readers. We will also not be selective of our data in which we only show the data that supports our expectations. We will also make sure to explain our results carefully and avoid making broad conclusions that are not supported by the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "No personally identifiable information will be shown in visualizations or shared outputs. Results will only be shown as group data. This means we will focus on trends across groups rather than individual officers. This helps protect privacy and reduces the risk of misidentifying or targeting individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "All code, data cleaning steps, and analysis methods will be documented in the notebook to ensure reproducibility. This allows others to understand how results were created and verify our work if needed. Keeping clear records also helps prevent mistakes and improves transparency in our research process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "- [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will check if any variables might indirectly reflect race. If we notice this, we will think carefully about whether we should use that variable or explain why it is needed. Our goal is to avoid results that could be unfair or misleading If we notice a variable may indirectly reflect sensitive demographic information, we will reconsider using it or explain why it is necessary.  \n",
