This is a statistical inference task that will assess whether observed complaint distributions differ significantly from expected distributions proportionally. We will use simple regression and statistical tests like a chi-square test or regression complaint rate modeling to evaluate disproportionality."

    "- [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project uses publicly available government and research datasets from sources such as NYC Open Data rather than collecting data directly from individuals. Because we are not interacting with individuals or collecting personal responses, traditional informed consent does not apply. However, we will still use the data responsibly and follow any data use guidelines provided by the original data sources. We will also be careful to present results in ways that do not harm individuals or communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be bias in civilian complaint data because not all misconduct gets reported. For example some people may not file complaints if they don't trust the police, don't know how to report, or think it won't make a difference. These are just some of the many reasons. Reporting may also vary between different communities. Because of this, complaint numbers don't perfectly show officer behavior. In our project, we will keep this limitation in mind and avoid treating complaint counts as direct proot of misconduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only use data that does not include personal identifying information or is grouped together so individual officers cannot be identified. For example we will not use officer names, badge numbers, or other identifying details. All results will be reported in group or summary form instead of focusing on individuals. This will help protect privacy and reduces the risk of someone being singled out or misidentified. We want to make sure our analysis focuses on overall trends rather than specific people.\n",
    "       \n",
    "- [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this project studies racial differences, it is important to carefully interpret results and avoid reinforcing stereotypes. We will be sure to frame findings as structural or systemic patterns rather than individual blame. We will also emphasize limitations of the data when presenting results. We will also be careful with how we explain our findings so they are not taken out of context. Our goal is to help people understand patterns in the data, not make assumptions about individuals or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    "- [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "All the datasets we used are publicly available and will be stored securely in password protected university environments such as  \n",

    "- [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis focuses on complaint data and officer demographics, which does not capture the full social and historical context of policing. We will be sure to acknowledge that complaint data does not fully represent all community experiences and will avoid making broad claims about behavior or intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Complaint data may reflect reporting bias, systemic bias, and uneven enforcement patterns. Not all misconduct is reported, and reporting rates may vary across different communities or neighborhoods. Because of this, complaint numbers may not fully represent actual behavior or incidents. We will test distributions carefully and clearly separate correlation from causation when interpreting results. We will also acknowledge these limitations when presenting our findings.\n",

    "- [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",

    "All visualizations and statistics will be presented clearly and without exaggeration. We will avoid making graphs that could be misleading or confusing to readers. We will also not be selective of our data in which we only show the data that supports our expectations. We will also make sure to explain our results carefully and avoid making broad conclusions that are not supported by the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "No personally identifiable information will be shown in visualizations or shared outputs. Results will only be shown as group data. This means we will focus on trends across groups rather than individual officers. This helps protect privacy and reduces the risk of misidentifying or targeting individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "All code, data cleaning steps, and analysis methods will be documented in the notebook to ensure reproducibility. This allows others to understand how results were created and verify our work if needed. Keeping clear records also helps prevent mistakes and improves transparency in our research process.\n",

Our goal is to avoid results that could be unfair or misleading If we notice a variable may indirectly reflect sensitive demographic information, we will reconsider using it or explain why it is necessary.  \n",
